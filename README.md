## ds-for-telco

This project demonstrates how to use the common utilized demo, DS for telco, to highlight the experiments and models API features in CDSW. 

1. dsfortelcointeractive.py simulates interactive DS work. 
2. dsfortelco_pyspark_exp.py and dsfortelco_sklearn_exp.py can be used with the experiments functionality. You can input 3 arguments, num trees, max depth, and impurity method to test a variety of scenarios which will be tracked by cdsw experiments.  
3. predict_churn_pyspark.py and predict_churn_sklearn.py can be used as the endpoints for the model APIs.
